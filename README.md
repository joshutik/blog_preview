## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt to us the media queries as most times i get confused on how to use the max and min property in the media query.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
@media screen and (max-width:430px) {
    .home {
        width: 100%;
        margin: 0%;
    }

    .card {
        outline: 1px solid black;
        width: 100%;
        max-width: 100%;
        background-color: white;
        border-radius: 14px;
        box-shadow: 6px 6px black;
        margin: auto;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue with making creating a webpage that has more interaction.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries_ex.asp) - This helped me in understanding the min and max.
